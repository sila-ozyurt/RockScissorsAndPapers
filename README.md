# RockScissorsAndPapers
 Rock scissors and papers game in python

Project Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. My goal was to apply fundamental programming concepts in Python and create an interactive game experience. Through this project, I aimed to improve my understanding of loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

Game Features
Game Rules: The game consists of three rounds, and the first player to win 2 rounds is the overall winner. In case of a tie, the round is not counted.
User and Computer: The user chooses between "rock", "scissors", or "paper", while the computer makes a random choice.
Post-Game: After each game, both the user and the computer are asked if they want to play another game. If both agree, a new game starts; otherwise, the game ends.
Usage


Requirements
Python 3.x
How to Run
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official site.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
Run the game using the following command:
